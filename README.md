# Employee Roster Generator 
  
  
  ## Description 

  This employee roster team generator app is a simple to use solution to adding a series of new hires or one off hires in a quick concise way. The generator will ask a series of questions and mark the new hire with their corresponding role. After the brief focus questions that will gather the new employees name, employee ID number, email and phone number, it will prompt what role this employy will have. There are a few additional questions for each specialty role outside of general employee.  Once the questions are answered the app will then generate a HTML file with the employee roster in nicely displayed cards.

  I really enjoyed this project since I am a hiring manager and though I work with a small team, it is really nice to be able to pull up a simple html that houses all of my employees contact information. In my current role, anytime someone leaves on vacation, or out of the territory, we are required to post out of office replies on voicemail and email. Typically this involves me scrolling through my phones contact cards and writing down information in order for me to recite the info to my voicemail or have pulled up while typing in my automatic reply. This card system makes it much easier to accomplish a regularly mundane task. This is just one application for this. 

  I also enjoyed this project as it really allowed me to see the fullstack for the first time bringing in all the skills previously learned, together. Creating a full front end from the backend and modifying the front end to be more end user friendly. 

  I believe this project stands out as a good representation of where I started 3 months ago and where I am today. It may not be the most effective application or the most built out application, however, it displayes a magnitude (for me) of different functions, tests, CSS, HTML, node packages including inquirer, jest and fs. Its pulling from APIs and cycling through other files to ultimately display in a friendly HTML browser page. Im happy with this progress.

  ## Installation
  The team generator app is easily installed on your computer. once you clone the repo into your desired file, you will simply need to go to your terminal and 'npm init -y' then 'npm i' to install all the proper node modules for the file. Incase you do not have the files, here is what I used for this file. Inquire.js, fs.js and jest.js. These should be installed prior to running the application. Once all the initialization is complete, simply open an integrated terminal in the index.js file and run 'node index.js'. The questions will begin to cycle in your terminal. After that is complete, simply go to the display folder and open the index.html file in your browser. .

  ## Usage

  I feel the best way to utilize this app would be for anyone that wants to categorize their employees in a simple fashion. This generator will continue to prompt questions until the data entry user is finished adding new employees. It will run for 3 employees or 3000. The app is simple in terms of data information but a handy way to store all names,IDs, emails, and phone numbers. Along with a few other metrics for specialty employees. .

  ## Contribution

  It would be ideal if credit could be noted. In addition, if someone wants to continue to build out this application to include a more detailed filing system or additional questions, to reach out to me and collaborate with me on building out the code. .

  ## Tests

  jest was primarily used to test all of the classes of employees. I simulated different scenarios for employee, manager, engineer and interns. Making sure all imputs were gathered properly and noted as issues..
